# Chapter 1: Security Concepts and Principles

## 1.1 Fundamentals goals of computer security
There are six high level computer security goals to aim for

1. **Confidentiality**: Keeping information private and can only be accessed with those who are authorized
*  We use two main approaches to achieve this. First, we have `access control`. In computer systems, the operating system does the job (i.e. it checks for usernames, passwords, and permissions before allowing access). Second, we use `encryption`. We use sophisticated mathematical algorithms to encrypt data, and only people with the correct 'key' can decrypt and read it


2. **Integrity**: 
Data remains unchanged since it was created.

3. **Authorization**: 
computing resources can only be accessed by those who are authorized. We can use <ins>access control</ins> to achieve authorization.

4. **Availability**:
Availability means to ensure that systems, services, and data are accessible when authorized users need them. 
* systems need to maintain enough capacity to handle legitimate requests, even during busy periods.
